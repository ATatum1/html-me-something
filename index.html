            <img src="images/attheairport.jpg" alt="Lambert Airport" height="200px" align="right"><br>
            <p>For my son's 6th birthday, my husband, son, mother-in-law, and I took a trip to Disney World. Our flight was scheduled to take off Sunday, March 3, 2019 at 6:50a. This was an exciting and anxious time as this was my son’s first time on an airplane. However, there was a major snowstorm predicted to start around 6:30-7a. The week leading up to the flight, I had debated to change our flight to avoid being stranded at the airport due to a cancellation. But, I chanced it and kept the original flight. Just before boarding, the snow started and it started to come down hard. But, everything went on as planned. Except, the plane had to be de-iced before takeoff. The landing was THE SMOOTHEST LANDING I have ever experienced. If I hadn’t been looking out of the window, I would have thought we were still in the air. Everyone clapped in amazement. I’ll never forget the pilot announcing, “how about that landing folks!” My son was happy to get off the plane to move around. We all were excited for the start of our trip.</p>

             <br>
             <p>After we checked into our room at the Pop Century Resort, we headed over to Hollywood Studios and rushed to Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular. We also went to the Disney Junior Dance Party, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, Toy Story Mania, and Muppet Vision 3D. We rushed back to the room to change before dinner and took a “Minnie-Van” to the Yachtsman Steakhouse at the Yacht Club Resort. Dinner was good, our waitress was great, and we were able to see some of the Illuminations fireworks from our table. My son was wiped out and fell asleep during dinner. I can’t remember what I ordered for dinner, but, I remember my dessert was salted caramel and popcorn flavored ice cream! By the end, we all could not wait to get back and go to bed. </p>

            <h2>Day 2: Animal Kingdom</h2>
            <img src="images/animalkingdom.jpg" alt="Animal Kingdom" height="315px" align="right">
            <p>The next day we made our way to Animal Kingdom. Our morning started off with a 2.5 hour wait for a 6 minute attraction, Avatar Flight of Passage. This was probably the most popular ride at the time, so it felt nice to check it off the list. I also was proud of myself as I am terrified of roller coasters and rides. We packed a lot into our day with: Na’vi River Journey, Kilimanjaro Safari (so cool to see the animals up close), It’s Tough to be a Bug!,Festival of the Lion King (my son’s favorite character is Simba),lunch at Yak and Yeti, Rivers of Light show, and The Boneyard. My son really enjoyed The Boneyard as it was a playground that allowed him to run around, play in sand, and climb. He didn’t have to wait around in a long line, he could just be a kid and enjoy himself. When we returned to our resort, we stopped at the arcade before returning to our room.  </p>

             <br>
             <p> On Day 3, we went to EPCOT. Some of our highlights were Spaceship Earth, Mission:Space, and Soarin’ Around the World. My son really wanted to see Muppet Vision 3D again so my mother-in-law took him on a boat ride back to Hollywood Studios to hang out. My husband and I went to the World Showcase, ate lunch in Mexico, and watched Illuminations. If you ask me, that show is so overrated. I had seen it about 9 years earlier and felt the same way. But, I wanted to give it another chance since it was being replaced with another show that year. But, it was still just as boring. We left just before the end to get on the Frozen Ever, Test Track, and Soarin’ again before the park closed. </p>

             <h2> Day 4: Magic Kingdom. Last Park Day</h2>
            <p> Our last park day was Magic Kingdom. We watched some of the parade and ate lunch at Columbia Harbor House. Some of our favorite attractions were: Mickey's PhilharMagic, Peter Pan’s Flight, The Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, Monsters Inc Laugh Floor and Enchanted Tales with Belle. Enchanted tales was one of my favorites because the kids were given roles and were part of the show. We grabbed some snacks and headed over to Cinderella’s Castle to watch the fireworks show, Happily Ever After. It was a sweet way to end our time at the parks. </p>

             <h2>Day 5: Animal Kingdom Lodge</h2>
             <p>
                On our non-park day, we checked out of Pop Century and into Animal Kingdom Resort. The only thing we had planned this day was dinner at Sanaa. The day leading up to dinner was unscheduled and restful. My son played in the arcade, playground, and pool. We grabbed a quick bite to eat for lunch and watched the animals from our balcony.

           <h2> Day 6: Happy Birthday! Leaving Disney World....</h2>
           <p>
            The next day, Friday, March 8, 2019 was my son's 7th birthday. I surprised my son with a customized Simba birthday shirt and revealed we all had similar shirts to celebrate his birthday. We were slow to rise as we wanted to stay to enjoy the room, however, we had to get going.  We checked out and caught an Uber from Disney World. I’m sure my son was bummed that not only were we leaving Disney World, but he had to return home on his birthday. After about a 40 minute ride, we arrived at Port Canaveral and revealed that not only was he not going home, but we were going on a Disney Cruise. “Surprise!” After checking our bags and going through security, we reached the top of the escalator and yet another birthday surprise for him. There to greet him was my mother, brother, sister-in-law, and his cousin. He was excited and a little overwhelmed.  After we checked in, we were greeted with, &#34Welcome the Tatum Family!&#34 as Disney Cruise Lines does with every family as they board the ship. We found our rooms, put our stuff down, and explored the ship. My mother, son, and I headed to the open house at the kids club and later met up with the rest of the family for the Sail Away Party. My son wasn’t as interested as he was ready to play in the water. This worked out as there was less of a crowd due to most people being at the party. As we sailed away, the horn let out a loud blast in the tune of &#34When You Wish Upon a Star.&#34 My son really wanted to go back to the kid’s club, so my husband and I dropped him off on our way to a show. When it was over, I picked up my son on the way to dinner at Animator's Palate. It was really cool. Crush from Finding Nemo went around on different screens and interacted with the different tables. After dinner, the staff sang happy birthday and we ate cake. 
 
The next day, we stopped at Nassau, Bahamas. We took a cab and hung out at a public beach in Paradise Island. Once back onboard, we rode on the Aquaduck,the ship’s water slide/coaster. After we changed clothes, my son again ditched us for the kid’s club and my husband and I went to a show. It was Pirate Night, after dinner, we headed to the Lido deck for the Pirate Party and fireworks. My brother and I checked out the Pirate buffet that followed. 
 
The following morning, we docked at Castaway Cay, Disney’s private island. We mostly hung out at the beach. Once back, my husband and I caught another show. After dinner, my son and husband were wiped out and stayed in the room. My brother, niece, and I went to the theatre to watch Captain Marvel. The next morning we ate breakfast and disembarked.  My mother and brother headed back to the airport, while the rest of us stayed overnight in Cocoa Beach. We returned home the next day. It was a long and exhausting trip, but we had a lot of fun. We can’t wait to do it all over again when my daughter gets older.
